## About LunaPress

ðŸŒš LunaPress is a modern ecosystem and typed wrapper over outdated WordPress code, created to accelerate and standardize plugin development.
After hundreds of implemented solutions, we identified common patterns, eliminated routine tasks, and gathered everything necessary to build a new generation of plugins â€” all in one place.

- Package and module system
- Wrappers over WP functions and their implementation in DI
- Psalm analysis and stubs
- Frontend with Vite and HMR
